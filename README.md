**# PRICE PREDICTION SOFTWARE (PPS)**
# Detail on what is price prediction?
The project is  focused on building  price prediction Application on 

Algorand. The team focus on developing the software and machine learning 

analysis for price forecasting. The price predictor software is an autonomous data processor and machine learning 

algorithm using neural networks to predict the future prices of digital assets. In its initial 

iteration, PPS as we call the app, will predict the price of the Algorand native asset, ALGO. However, the PPS 

model was built for interoperability across Algorand, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Bitcoin 

and Ethereum, were included because of their market prevalence as the two largest blockchains.

Cardano was included because like Algorand, it also operates on a proof-of-stake blockchain and 

has seen rapid growth over the past fiscal year.

PPS relies on open and transparent blockchain data to derive meaningful insights and 

economic analysis regarding the blockchain tokenomics. PPS automatically aggregates data 

about digital assets, generating an updated set every time it is trained. This eliminates the manual 

collection of data, thus making PPS more computationally efficient. To facilitate the learning 

process,  PPS utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs). An RNN is a neural network 

tailored for sequential series of information in which the output contributes to its own input.

Trading bot to use data from PPS to predict arbitrage cycles and correct for market 

inefficiencies.
